/**
 * Enable synchronization between XML infoset nodes and JAXB objects 
 * representing same XML document.
 *
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class maintains the association between XML nodes of
 * an infoset preserving view and a JAXB representation of an XML document. 
 * Navigation between the two views is provided by the methods
 * {@link #getXMLNode(Object)} and {@link #getJAXBNode(Object)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Modifications can be made to either the infoset preserving view or the 
 * JAXB representation of the document while the other view remains 
 * unmodified. The binder is able to synchronize the changes made in the 
 * modified view back into the other view using the appropriate
 * Binder update methods, {@link #updateXML(Object, Object)} or 
 * {@link #updateJAXB(Object)}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A typical usage scenario is the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>load XML document into an XML infoset representation</li>
 *   <li>{@link #unmarshal(Object)} XML infoset view to JAXB view.
 *       (Note to conserve resources, it is possible to only unmarshal a
 *       subtree of the XML infoset view to the JAXB view.)</li>
 *   <li>application access/updates JAXB view of XML document.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #updateXML(Object)} synchronizes modifications to JAXB view 
 *       back into the XML infoset view. Update operation preserves as 
 *       much of original XML infoset as possible (i.e. comments, PI, ...)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Binder instance is created using the factory method 
 * {@link JAXBContext#createBinder()} or {@link JAXBContext#createBinder(Class)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The template parameter, <code>XmlNode</code>, is the
 * root interface/class for the XML infoset preserving representation.
 * A Binder implementation is required to minimally support
 * an <code>XmlNode</code> value of <code>org.w3c.dom.Node.class</code>. 
 * A Binder implementation can support alternative XML infoset 
 * preserving representations.
