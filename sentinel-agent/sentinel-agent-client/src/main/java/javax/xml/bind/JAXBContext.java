/**
 * <p>
 * The <tt>JAXBContext</tt> class provides the client's entry point to the 
 * JAXB API. It provides an abstraction for managing the XML/Java binding 
 * information necessary to implement the JAXB binding framework operations: 
 * unmarshal, marshal and validate.
 *
 * <p>A client application normally obtains new instances of this class using
 * one of these two styles for newInstance methods, although there are other 
 * specialized forms of the method available:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #newInstance(String,ClassLoader) JAXBContext.newInstance( "com.acme.foo:com.acme.bar" )} <br/>
 *   The JAXBContext instance is initialized from a list of colon 
 *   separated Java package names. Each java package contains
 *   JAXB mapped classes, schema-derived classes and/or user annotated 
 *   classes. Additionally, the java package may contain JAXB package annotations 
 *   that must be processed. (see JLS 3rd Edition, Section 7.4.1. Package Annotations).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>{@link #newInstance(Class...) JAXBContext.newInstance( com.acme.foo.Foo.class )} <br/>
 *    The JAXBContext instance is intialized with class(es) 
 *    passed as parameter(s) and classes that are statically reachable from 
 *    these class(es). See {@link #newInstance(Class...)} for details.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * <i><B>SPEC REQUIREMENT:</B> the provider must supply an implementation
 * class containing the following method signatures:</i>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public static JAXBContext createContext( String contextPath, ClassLoader classLoader, Map<String,Object> properties ) throws JAXBException
 * public static JAXBContext createContext( Class[] classes, Map<String,Object> properties ) throws JAXBException
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><i>
 * The following JAXB 1.0 requirement is only required for schema to 
 * java interface/implementation binding. It does not apply to JAXB annotated
 * classes. JAXB Providers must generate a <tt>jaxb.properties</tt> file in 
 * each package containing schema derived classes.  The property file must 
 * contain a property named <tt>javax.xml.bind.context.factory</tt> whose 
 * value is the name of the class that implements the <tt>createContext</tt> 
 * APIs.</i>
 * 
 * <p><i>
 * The class supplied by the provider does not have to be assignable to 
 * <tt>javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext</tt>, it simply has to provide a class that
 * implements the <tt>createContext</tt> APIs.</i>
 * 
 * <p><i>
 * In addition, the provider must call the 
 * {@link DatatypeConverter#setDatatypeConverter(DatatypeConverterInterface) 
 * DatatypeConverter.setDatatypeConverter} api prior to any client 
 * invocations of the marshal and unmarshal methods.  This is necessary to 
 * configure the datatype converter that will be used during these operations.</i>

 * <a name="Unmarshalling"></a>
 * <b>Unmarshalling</b>
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * The {@link Unmarshaller} class provides the client application the ability
 * to convert XML data into a tree of Java content objects.
 * The unmarshal method allows for 
 * any global XML element declared in the schema to be unmarshalled as
 * the root of an instance document.
 * Additionally, the unmarshal method allows for an unrecognized root element that 
 * has  an xsi:type attribute's value that references a type definition declared in 
 * the schema  to be unmarshalled as the root of an instance document.
 * The <tt>JAXBContext</tt> object 
 * allows the merging of global elements and type definitions across a set of schemas (listed
 * in the <tt>contextPath</tt>). Since each schema in the schema set can belong
 * to distinct namespaces, the unification of schemas to an unmarshalling 
 * context should be namespace independent.  This means that a client 
 * application is able to unmarshal XML documents that are instances of
 * any of the schemas listed in the <tt>contextPath</tt>.  For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *        JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance( "com.acme.foo:com.acme.bar" );
 *        Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller();
 *        FooObject fooObj = (FooObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "foo.xml" ) ); // ok
 *        BarObject barObj = (BarObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "bar.xml" ) ); // ok
 *        BazObject bazObj = (BazObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "baz.xml" ) ); // error, "com.acme.baz" not in contextPath
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The client application may also generate Java content trees explicitly rather
 * than unmarshalling existing XML data.  For all JAXB-annotated value classes,
 * an application can create content using constructors. 
 * For schema-derived interface/implementation classes and for the
 * creation of elements that are not bound to a JAXB-annotated
 * class, an application needs to have access and knowledge about each of 
 * the schema derived <tt> ObjectFactory</tt> classes that exist in each of 
 * java packages contained in the <tt>contextPath</tt>.  For each schema 
 * derived java class, there is a static factory method that produces objects 
 * of that type.  For example, 
 * assume that after compiling a schema, you have a package <tt>com.acme.foo</tt> 
 * that contains a schema derived interface named <tt>PurchaseOrder</tt>.  In 
 * order to create objects of that type, the client application would use the 
 * factory method like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *       com.acme.foo.PurchaseOrder po = 
 *           com.acme.foo.ObjectFactory.createPurchaseOrder();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Once the client application has an instance of the the schema derived object,
 * it can use the mutator methods to set content on it.
 *
 * <p>
 * For more information on the generated <tt>ObjectFactory</tt> classes, see
 * Section 4.2 <i>Java Package</i> of the specification.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i><B>SPEC REQUIREMENT:</B> the provider must generate a class in each
 * package that contains all of the necessary object factory methods for that 
 * package named ObjectFactory as well as the static 
 * <tt>newInstance( javaContentInterface )</tt> method</i>  
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Marshalling</b>
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * The {@link Marshaller} class provides the client application the ability
 * to convert a Java content tree back into XML data.  There is no difference
 * between marshalling a content tree that is created manually using the factory
 * methods and marshalling a content tree that is the result an <tt>unmarshal
 * </tt> operation.  Clients can marshal a java content tree back to XML data
 * to a <tt>java.io.OutputStream</tt> or a <tt>java.io.Writer</tt>.  The 
 * marshalling process can alternatively produce SAX2 event streams to a 
 * registered <tt>ContentHandler</tt> or produce a DOM Node object.  
 * Client applications have control over the output encoding as well as 
 * whether or not to marshal the XML data as a complete document or 
 * as a fragment.
 *
 * <p>
 * Here is a simple example that unmarshals an XML document and then marshals
 * it back out:
 *
 * <pre>
 *        JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance( "com.acme.foo" );
 *
 *        // unmarshal from foo.xml
 *        Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller();
 *        FooObject fooObj = (FooObject)u.unmarshal( new File( "foo.xml" ) );
 *
 *        // marshal to System.out
 *        Marshaller m = jc.createMarshaller();
 *        m.marshal( fooObj, System.out );
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Validation</b>
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * Validation has been changed significantly since JAXB 1.0.  The {@link Validator}
 * class has been deprecated and made optional.  This means that you are advised
 * not to use this class and, in fact, it may not even be available depending on
 * your JAXB provider.  JAXB 1.0 client applications that rely on <tt>Validator</tt>
 * will still work properly when deployed with the JAXB 1.0 runtime system.
 *
 * In JAXB 2.0, the {@link Unmarshaller} has included convenince methods that expose
 * the JAXP 1.3 {@link javax.xml.validation} framework.  Please refer to the
 * {@link Unmarshaller#setSchema(javax.xml.validation.Schema)} API for more
 * information.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>JAXB Runtime Binding Framework Compatibility</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 * The following JAXB 1.0 restriction only applies to binding schema to 
 * interfaces/implementation classes.
 * Since this binding does not require a common runtime system, a JAXB 
 * client application must not attempt to mix runtime objects (<tt>JAXBContext,
 * Marshaller</tt>, etc. ) from different providers.  This does not 
 * mean that the client application isn't portable, it simply means that a 
 * client has to use a runtime system provided by the same provider that was 
 * used to compile the schema.
