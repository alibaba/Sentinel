/**
 * Class that defines convenience methods for common, simple use of JAXB.
 *
 * <p>
 * Methods defined in this class are convenience methods that combine several basic operations
 * in the {@link JAXBContext}, {@link Unmarshaller}, and {@link Marshaller}.
 *
 * They are designed
 * to be the prefered methods for developers new to JAXB. They have
 * the following characterstics:
 *
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Generally speaking, the performance is not necessarily optimal.
 *      It is expected that people who need to write performance
 *      critical code will use the rest of the JAXB API directly.
 *  <li>Errors that happen during the processing is wrapped into
 *      {@link DataBindingException} (which will have {@link JAXBException}
 *      as its {@link Throwable#getCause() cause}. It is expected that
 *      people who prefer the checked exception would use
 *      the rest of the JAXB API directly.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, the <tt>unmarshal</tt> methods have the following characteristic:
 *
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Schema validation is not performed on the input XML.
 *      The processing will try to continue even if there
 *      are errors in the XML, as much as possible. Only as
 *      the last resort, this method fails with {@link DataBindingException}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Similarly, the <tt>marshal</tt> methods have the following characteristic:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>The processing will try to continue even if the Java object tree
 *      does not meet the validity requirement. Only as
 *      the last resort, this method fails with {@link DataBindingException}.
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * All the methods on this class require non-null arguments to all parameters.
 * The <tt>unmarshal</tt> methods either fail with an exception or return
 * a non-null value.
