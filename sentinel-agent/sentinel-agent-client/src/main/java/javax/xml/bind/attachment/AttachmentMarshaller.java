 * delegating the creation of referenceable MIME parts to

 *
 * <p>XOP processing is enabled when {@link #isXOPPackage()} is true.
 *    See {@link #addMtomAttachment(DataHandler, String, String)} for details.

 * <p>WS-I Attachment Profile 1.0 is supported by

     * <p>Consider MIME content <code>data</code> for optimized binary storage as an attachment.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method is called by JAXB marshal process when {@link #isXOPPackage()} is 
     * <code>true</code>, for each element whose datatype is "base64Binary", as described in 
     * Step 3 in

     *
     * <p>
     * The method implementor determines whether <code>data</code> shall be attached separately 
     * or inlined as base64Binary data. If the implementation chooses to optimize the storage 
     * of the binary data as a MIME part, it is responsible for attaching <code>data</code> to the 
     * MIME-based package, and then assigning an unique content-id, cid, that identifies
     * the MIME part within the MIME message. This method returns the cid, 
     * which enables the JAXB marshaller to marshal a XOP element that refers to that cid in place
     * of marshalling the binary data. When the method returns null, the JAXB marshaller
     * inlines <code>data</code> as base64binary data.
     *
     * <p>
     * The caller of this method is required to meet the following constraint.
     * If the element infoset item containing <code>data</code> has the attribute 
     * <code>xmime:contentType</code> or if the JAXB property/field representing 
     * <code>data</code>is annotated with a known MIME type, 
     * <code>data.getContentType()</code> should be set to that MIME type.
     *
     * <p>
     * The <code>elementNamespace</code> and <code>elementLocalName</code>
     * parameters provide the
     * context that contains the binary data. This information could
     * be used by the MIME-based package processor to determine if the
     * binary data should be inlined or optimized as an attachment.
     *
     * @param data
     *       represents the data to be attached. Must be non-null.
     * @param elementNamespace
     *      the namespace URI of the element that encloses the base64Binary data.
     *      Can be empty but never null. 
     * @param elementLocalName
     *      The local name of the element. Always a non-null valid string.
     *        
     * @return
     *     a valid content-id URI (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xop10/#RFC2387">RFC 2387</a>) that identifies the attachment containing <code>data</code>.     
     *     Otherwise, null if the attachment was not added and should instead be inlined in the message.
