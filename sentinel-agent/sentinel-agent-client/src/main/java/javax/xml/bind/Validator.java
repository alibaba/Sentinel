/**
 * As of JAXB 2.0, this class is deprecated and optional.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>Validator</tt> class is responsible for controlling the validation

 * <b>Three Forms of Validation</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 *    <dl>
 *        <dt><b>Unmarshal-Time Validation</b></dt>
 *        <dd>This form of validation enables a client application to receive 
 *            information about validation errors and warnings detected while
 *            unmarshalling XML data into a Java content tree and is completely 
 *            orthogonal to the other types of validation.  To enable or disable 
 *            it, see the javadoc for 
 *            {@link Unmarshaller#setValidating(boolean) Unmarshaller.setValidating}.
 *            All JAXB 1.0 Providers are required to support this operation.
 *        </dd>
 *
 *        <dt><b>On-Demand Validation</b></dt>
 *        <dd> This form of validation enables a client application to receive 
 *             information about validation errors and warnings detected in the 
 *             Java content tree.  At any point, client applications can call
 *             the {@link Validator#validate(Object) Validator.validate} method
 *             on the Java content tree (or any sub-tree of it).  All JAXB 1.0
 *             Providers are required to support this operation.
 *        </dd>
 *
 *        <dt><b>Fail-Fast Validation</b></dt>
 *        <dd> This form of validation enables a client application to receive 
 *             immediate feedback about modifications to the Java content tree 
 *             that violate type constraints on Java Properties as defined in 
 *             the specification.  JAXB Providers are not required support
 *             this type of validation.  Of the JAXB Providers that do support
 *             this type of validation, some may require you to decide at schema
 *             compile time whether or not a client application will be allowed
 *             to request fail-fast validation at runtime.
 *        </dd>
 *    </dl>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <tt>Validator</tt> class is responsible for managing On-Demand Validation.  
 * The <tt>Unmarshaller</tt> class is responsible for managing Unmarshal-Time 
 * Validation during the unmarshal operations.  Although there is no formal
 * method of enabling validation during the marshal operations, the 
 * <tt>Marshaller</tt> may detect errors, which will be reported to the 
 * <tt>ValidationEventHandler</tt> registered on it.
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="defaulthandler"></a>
 * <b>Using the Default EventHandler</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 *   If the client application does not set an event handler on their 
 *   <tt>Validator</tt>, <tt>Unmarshaller</tt>, or <tt>Marshaller</tt> prior to 
 *   calling the validate, unmarshal, or marshal methods, then a default event 
 *   handler will receive notification of any errors or warnings encountered.  
 *   The default event handler will cause the current operation to halt after 
 *   encountering the first error or fatal error (but will attempt to continue 
 *   after receiving warnings).
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="handlingevents"></a>
 * <b>Handling Validation Events</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 *   There are three ways to handle events encountered during the unmarshal,
 *   validate, and marshal operations:
 *    <dl>
 *        <dt>Use the default event handler</dt>
 *        <dd>The default event handler will be used if you do not specify one
 *            via the <tt>setEventHandler</tt> API's on <tt>Validator</tt>, 
 *            <tt>Unmarshaller</tt>, or <tt>Marshaller</tt>.
 *        </dd>
 * 
 *        <dt>Implement and register a custom event handler</dt>
 *        <dd>Client applications that require sophisticated event processing
 *            can implement the <tt>ValidationEventHandler</tt> interface and 
 *            register it with the <tt>Unmarshaller</tt> and/or 
 *            <tt>Validator</tt>.
 *        </dd>
 *
 *        <dt>Use the {@link javax.xml.bind.util.ValidationEventCollector ValidationEventCollector} 
 *            utility</dt>
 *        <dd>For convenience, a specialized event handler is provided that
 *            simply collects any <tt>ValidationEvent</tt> objects created 
 *            during the unmarshal, validate, and marshal operations and 
 *            returns them to the client application as a 
 *            <tt>java.util.Collection</tt>.
 *        </dd>
 *    </dl>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Validation and Well-Formedness</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Validation events are handled differently depending on how the client 
 * application is configured to process them as described in the previous
 * section.  However, there are certain cases where a JAXB Provider indicates
 * that it is no longer able to reliably detect and report errors.  In these
 * cases, the JAXB Provider will set the severity of the ValidationEvent to
 * FATAL_ERROR to indicate that the unmarshal, validate, or marshal operations 
 * should be terminated.  The default event handler and 
 * <tt>ValidationEventCollector</tt> utility class must terminate processing 
 * after being notified of a fatal error.  Client applications that supply their 
 * own <tt>ValidationEventHandler</tt> should also terminate processing after
 * being notified of a fatal error.  If not, unexpected behaviour may occur.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="supportedProps"></a>
 * <b>Supported Properties</b><br>
 * <blockquote>
 * <p>
 * There currently are not any properties required to be supported by all 
 * JAXB Providers on Validator.  However, some providers may support 
 * their own set of provider specific properties.
