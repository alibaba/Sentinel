/**
 * <p>
 * Combined the runtime statistics collected from the previous
 * slots (NodeSelectorSlot, ClusterNodeBuilderSlot, and StatisticSlot), FlowSlot
 * will use pre-set rules to decide whether the incoming requests should be
 * blocked.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code SphU.entry(resourceName)} will throw {@code FlowException} if any rule is
 * triggered. Users can customize their own logic by catching {@code FlowException}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One resource can have multiple flow rules. FlowSlot traverses these rules
 * until one of them is triggered or all rules have been traversed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each {@link FlowRule} is mainly composed of these factors: grade, strategy, path. We
 * can combine these factors to achieve different effects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The grade is defined by the {@code grade} field in {@link FlowRule}. Here, 0 for thread
 * isolation and 1 for request count shaping (QPS). Both thread count and request
 * count are collected in real runtime, and we can view these statistics by
 * following command:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * curl http://localhost:8719/tree
 *
 * idx id    thread pass  blocked   success total aRt   1m-pass   1m-block   1m-all   exception
 * 2   abc647 0      460    46          46   1    27      630       276        897      0
 * </pre>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code thread} for the count of threads that is currently processing the resource</li>
 * <li>{@code pass} for the count of incoming request within one second</li>
 * <li>{@code blocked} for the count of requests blocked within one second</li>
 * <li>{@code success} for the count of the requests successfully handled by Sentinel within one second</li>
 * <li>{@code RT} for the average response time of the requests within a second</li>
 * <li>{@code total} for the sum of incoming requests and blocked requests within one second</li>
 * <li>{@code 1m-pass} is for the count of incoming requests within one minute</li>
 * <li>{@code 1m-block} is for the count of a request blocked within one minute</li>
 * <li>{@code 1m-all} is the total of incoming and blocked requests within one minute</li>
 * <li>{@code exception} is for the count of business (customized) exceptions in one second</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This stage is usually used to protect resources from occupying. If a resource
 * takes long time to finish, threads will begin to occupy. The longer the
 * response takes, the more threads occupy.
 *
 * Besides counter, thread pool or semaphore can also be used to achieve this.
 *
 * - Thread pool: Allocate a thread pool to handle these resource. When there is
 * no more idle thread in the pool, the request is rejected without affecting
 * other resources.
 *
 * - Semaphore: Use semaphore to control the concurrent count of the threads in
 * this resource.
 *
 * The benefit of using thread pool is that, it can walk away gracefully when
 * time out. But it also bring us the cost of context switch and additional
 * threads. If the incoming requests is already served in a separated thread,
 * for instance, a Servlet HTTP request, it will almost double the threads count if
 * using thread pool.
 *
 * <h3>Traffic Shaping</h3>
 * <p>
 * When QPS exceeds the threshold, Sentinel will take actions to control the incoming request,
 * and is configured by {@code controlBehavior} field in flow rules.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Immediately reject ({@code RuleConstant.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT})</li>
 * <p>
 * This is the default behavior. The exceeded request is rejected immediately
 * and the FlowException is thrown
 * </p>
 *
 * <li>Warmup ({@code RuleConstant.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR_WARM_UP})</li>
 * <p>
 * If the load of system has been low for a while, and a large amount of
 * requests comes, the system might not be able to handle all these requests at
 * once. However if we steady increase the incoming request, the system can warm
 * up and finally be able to handle all the requests.
 * This warmup period can be configured by setting the field {@code warmUpPeriodSec} in flow rules.
 * </p>
 *
 * <li>Uniform Rate Limiting ({@code RuleConstant.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR_RATE_LIMITER})</li>
 * <p>
 * This strategy strictly controls the interval between requests.
 * In other words, it allows requests to pass at a stable, uniform rate.
 * </p>
 * <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/alibaba/Sentinel/image/uniform-speed-queue.png" style="max-width:
 * 60%;"/>
 * <p>
 * This strategy is an implement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket">leaky bucket</a>.
 * It is used to handle the request at a stable rate and is often used in burst traffic (e.g. message handling).
 * When a large number of requests beyond the system’s capacity arrive
 * at the same time, the system using this strategy will handle requests and its
 * fixed rate until all the requests have been processed or time out.
 * </p>
